# GeometryLab-Material-Classification

A prototype for a workflow that classifies and quantifies materials in 3d building scans

Refer to the "Notebooks" directory for a set of Jupyter Notebooks that perform the required functions.

The "Legacy Grasshopper" directory contains the Geometry Lab's Grasshopper scripts that were the prototype workflow for applying materials to the model. We have since ported all that functionality a jupyter notebook found in the "Notebooks" directory. We used the Grasshopper scripts to generate frames for a video that we made that illustrates the process. This being said there is no particular reason you should use these as they are harder to work with than the notebooks.
